<p>Here goes nothing! My first blog post. I’ve been building this website over the past week, 
    with the intention of fostering what I used to love about the internet: creativity, connection, 
    and exploration. I’ve felt jaded by social media and corporate design in recent years. It’s time 
    for me to return to my values and build something uniquely human (even if it involves a nauseating 
    amount of blinkies).</p>

<p>As a developer, I also chose to simplify my approach to coding this project. For now, it’s plain 
    HTML/CSS. No React, no frameworks, not even JavaScript. I may switch to a static site generator 
    down the road, but I decided to prioritize having <em>something</em> over having something perfect. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my little slice of the internet!</p>
